# Wireless-Charging-Station-for-EV-s
This project simulates a wireless EV charging station using Arduino and Proteus. An ultrasonic sensor detects vehicle arrival, activating a relay to start wireless charging through inductive coils. An LED and LCD display show real-time charging status. Includes complete Arduino code and Proteus simulation.
